# THINGS THAT I LEARNT FROM IT

## transform-origin
to rotate an item from the right-end rather than from the middle, set:
```css
transform-origin: 100%
```
by default it is 50%, which helps to rotate from the middle
```css
transform-origin: 50%
```
## transition-timing-function
It (along with cubic-bezier function) was used to give an effect to the seconds hand.
```css
transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.1, 2.7, 0.58, 1);
```
